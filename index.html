                     <p class="about_text">When Dorothy famously triumphed over the Wicked Witch of the West, we only ever heard one side of the story. 
                        Wicked tells the incredible story of an unlikely but profound friendship between two young women: the very popular Glinda and a misunderstood girl with green skin named Elphaba. 
                        Following an encounter with the mysterious Wizard of Oz, their friendship reaches a crossroad and their lives take very different paths. 
                        While Glinda’s unflinching desire for popularity sees her seduced by power, 
                        Elphaba’s determination to remain true to herself and those around her will have unexpected and shocking consequences on her future. 
                        Their extraordinary adventures in Oz will ultimately see them fulfill their destinies as Glinda the Good and the Wicked Witch of the West.

Oh, dear students, how I wish you could have seen it as it once was. Where you could walk down the halls and see an antelope explicating a sonnet, a snow leopard solving an equation, a wildebeast waxing philosophic. Don't you see, dear students, how our dear Oz is becoming less and less...... colorful. Now, who can tell me what sent these events into motion? No-one? Well it all began with the great drought, food grew scarce, people grew hungrier and angrier. And the question became “Whom can we blame”? Can anybody tell me what is meant by the term “scapegoat”?</p>

                     <p>Oh the Governor made his concern for your sister’s well-being quite apparent—she will share my compartment, where I can assist her as needed. (To Elphaba) He never mentioned you. Just a slight gulch—not to fret! We’ll find some place to put you! Attention! Which of you young ladies will volunteer to share with Miss Elphaba? Oh, thank you, dear. That is very good of you.</p>
